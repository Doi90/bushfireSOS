This package stores all of the functions required to fit species
distribution models to Australian species in response to the 2019-2020
bushfire crisis.

## Installation

<!-- You can install the released version of bushfireSOS from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with: -->

<!-- ``` r -->

<!-- install.packages("bushfireSOS") -->

<!-- ``` -->

Install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Doi90/bushfireSOS")
```

<!-- ## Example -->

<!-- This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem: -->

<!-- ```{r example} -->

<!-- library(bushfireSOS) -->

<!-- ## basic example code -->

<!-- ``` -->

<!-- What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so: -->

<!-- ```{r cars} -->

<!-- summary(cars) -->

<!-- ``` -->

<!-- You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. -->

<!-- You can also embed plots, for example: -->

<!-- ```{r pressure, echo = FALSE} -->

<!-- plot(pressure) -->

<!-- ``` -->

<!-- In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub! -->
